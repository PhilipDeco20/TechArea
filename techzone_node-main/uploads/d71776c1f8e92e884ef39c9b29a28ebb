Stanza 1
If home is really where the heart is
Then home must be a place we all can share
for even with our difference our hearts are much the same
And where love is we come together there.

Chorus
Wherever there is laughter ringing
Someone smiling, someone dreaming
We can live together there
Love will be our home.

Wherever there are children singing
Where a tender heart is beating
We can live together there
Love will be our home

Stanza 2
With love our hearts can be a family
And hope can bring this family face to face
And though we may be far apart our hearts can be as one
When love brings us together in one place.

Chorus
Wherever there is laughter ringing
Someone smiling, someone dreaming
We can live together there
Love will be our home.

Where there are words of kindness spoken
Where a vow is never broken
We can live together there
Love will be our home

Love will, love will be our home
Love will, love will be our home
Love will, love will be our home
Love will, love will be our home

Wherever there is laughter ringing
Someone smiling, someone dreaming
We can live together there
Love will be our home.

Where there are children singing
Where a tender heart is beating
We can live together there
Love will be our home

Medley:
 O Give Us Homes Where Christ Is Lord And Master,
The Bible Read, The Precious Hymns Still Sung;
Where Pray’r Comes First In Peace Or In Disaster,
And Praise Is Natural Speech To Ev’ry Tongue;
Where Mountains Move Before A Faith That’s Vaster,
And Christ Sufficient Is For Old And Young.
